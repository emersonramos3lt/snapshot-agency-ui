- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** for subtle and elegant fade-in animations  
- **Custom animated cursor** that smoothly follows the user's movements, adding a unique interactive touch  
- **Responsive design**, perfectly adapting to all screen sizes for seamless browsing  
- **Black and white color palette** for a clean, high-end aesthetic  
- **Smooth hover effects** that bring content to life while maintaining a minimalist look  
- **Animated image slider** created with HTML and CSS keyframes, featuring smooth transitions  
- **Pause-on-hover effect**: when hovering over an image in the slider, the animation pauses and that specific image retains its color while the others turn black and white â€” drawing the viewerâ€™s focus to the image under the cursor
